    "contents" : "Run_analysis Code Book\n========================================================\n\n##Study Design\nData Collection: Data was collected from the UCI.edu site. That data split smart phone sensor readings across multiple files including test and training files as well as subject, feature and activity files. \n\nReading from the article, objective is to determine what activity is being performed across subjects. That is the \"y\" or dependent factor variable activityLabel (also ActivityName). For this six activity model, I have selected 70 variables according to the following criteria: \n\nTime domain (“t”) vs. Fourier (“f”) means and std devs:\nTime-based data is raw movement data plotted over time. Fourier transformation seeks to isolate periodic, wave-like, oscillations in the data using trigonometric sub-functions (sines, cosines, etc). Given the repetitive nature of movements in the activities to be predicted, I believe Fourier will be more predictive. Therefore, where Time and Fourier options existed, I chose Fourier. Three Time variables don’t have Fourier Transforms (GravityAcc, GravityAccMag and BodyGyroJerk). I included these means and std devs.\n\nBody vs. Gravity means and standard deviations:\nWhen predicting activity, my hypothesis is that measurements inclusive of gravity will better separate activities with similar motions (e.g., walking, walking up stairs, walking down stairs). Therefore, where Gravity and Body are options, I’ve chosen Gravity. \n\nAcceleration vs. Gyro:\nThese represent readings from two different sensors (the accelerometer and the gyroscope). Therefore, I included means and std devs for both types of sensor readings.\n\nJerk readings:\nJerk signals indicate change in the direction of motion. Used in conjunction with means and std devs for continuous movements (Acc and Gyro measures), these will be important ways of discriminating between activities w/ different movement patterns. Therefore, I included Jerk mean and std devs.\n\n##Code Book\nThree data files are created: 1. 'masterData.txt': Merged file containing all input data, 2. 'activitySubjectMeans.txt': Means for 39 key features by activity/subject, 3. 'listOfVariables.csv': List of key features. \n\nKey features chosen are:\n\n1.    activityLabel\n\n2.\tactivityName\n\n3.\tactivitySubject\n\n4.\ttGravityAccmeanX\n\n5.\ttGravityAccmeanY\n\n6.\ttGravityAccmeanZ\n\n7.\ttGravityAccstdX\n\n8.\ttGravityAccstdY\n\n9.\ttGravityAccstdZ\n\n10.\ttGravityAccMagmean\n\n11.\ttGravityAccMagstd\n\n12.\ttBodyGyroJerkMagmean\n\n13.\ttBodyGyroJerkMagstd\n\n14.\tfBodyAccmeanX\n\n15.\tfBodyAccmeanY\n\n16.\tfBodyAccmeanZ\n\n17.\tfBodyAccstdX\n\n18.\tfBodyAccstdY\n\n19.\tfBodyAccstdZ\n\n20.\tfBodyAccJerkmeanX\n\n21.\tfBodyAccJerkmeanY\n\n22.\tfBodyAccJerkmeanZ\n\n23.\tfBodyAccJerkstdX\n\n24.\tfBodyAccJerkstdY\n\n25.\tfBodyAccJerkstdZ\n\n26.\tfBodyGyromeanX\n\n27.\tfBodyGyromeanY\n\n28.\tfBodyGyromeanZ\n\n29.\tfBodyGyrostdX\n\n30.\tfBodyGyrostdY\n\n31.\tfBodyGyrostdZ\n\n32.\tfBodyAccMagmean\n\n33.\tfBodyAccMagstd\n\n34.\tfBodyBodyAccJerkMagmean\n\n35.\tfBodyBodyAccJerkMagstd\n\n36.\tfBodyBodyGyroMagmean\n\n37.\tfBodyBodyGyroMagstd\n\n38.\tfBodyBodyGyroJerkMagmean\n\n39.\tfBodyBodyGyroJerkMagstd",
